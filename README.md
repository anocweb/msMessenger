# msMessenger

Description:
Originally started as a project to better familiarize myself with C# and quickly turned into an actual working application. 

Usage:
Set your credentials and click test connection. It should work immediately but it will select your first available DID. 

Requires voip.ms account with DID capable of SMS

Updates:

Intial Upload: Has some functionality but is VERY buggy
- Can send/receive messages (sending is buggy/imcomplete)
- No optimization and tons of test code :S
- Cannot select DID, defaults to first available with SMS
